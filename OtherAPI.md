# Configuring for other APIs

This page will detail what chanegs need to be made to connect MateChat to other API providers.

This assumes that you have installed MelonLoader and MateChat, and that they are already running correctly.

## CloudFlare (Default model)
1. Create an account at [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. Once you are logged into the CloudFlare dashboard:
    - Click on AI on the left hand menu
        - The click on Workers API.
    - Click on 'Use REST API' at the topof the screen.
    - Click Create a Workers AI API Token
        - This will pop a window open on the right. You can change the name of the token here.
        - Click Create API Token at the bottom.
        - Copy the API token that is created. This is the only time you will see the token.
        - Click Finish at the bottom.
    - The token that you just created will be added to the config file as the API_KEY.
    - Copy the Account ID. This will be added to the config file as the ACCOUNT_ID.
3. Click Back at the top of the screen. 
    - Select and copy the Model that you want to use. You will only need the part ater the slash
        - For example, CloudFlare's @cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct model, you would just need the llama-3-8b-instruct portion.
    - This will be added to the config file as MODEL_NAME.
